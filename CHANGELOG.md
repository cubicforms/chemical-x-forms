## Unreleased

_No unreleased changes yet._

## v0.11.0
**What's new at a glance**

- **`state` — the form-level reactive bundle.** Nine form-level
  scalars (`isDirty`, `isValid`, `isSubmitting`, `isValidating`,
  `submitCount`, `submitError`, `canUndo`, `canRedo`, `historySize`)
  previously lived as top-level `Readonly<ComputedRef<X>>` fields on
  `useForm()`'s return. They're now collated on a single `state`
  object (`reactive()` + `readonly()` under the hood). Templates
  bind to primitives directly — `:disabled="form.state.isSubmitting"`
  just works — and scripts read without `.value`.
- **`fieldErrors` is a Proxy view.** The ComputedRef wrapper is gone.
  Templates and scripts both dot-access through
  `form.fieldErrors.email` without `.value`. Still readonly (compile
  time via the type + runtime via Proxy traps that warn + reject).

**Breaking changes**

Three migrations since 0.10, all shaped by the same Vue template-
auto-unwrap limitation — refs nested inside API *objects* don't
unwrap, and our API was making consumers pay for it.

- **`fieldErrors.value` is gone.** Drop `.value` everywhere. Watchers
  must use the getter form: `watch(() => api.fieldErrors.email, …)`
  rather than `watch(api.fieldErrors, …)`.
- **9 top-level scalars moved to `state`.**

  ```diff
  - form.isDirty.value
  - form.isSubmitting.value
  - form.canUndo.value
  + form.state.isDirty
  + form.state.isSubmitting
  + form.state.canUndo
  ```

  …for all 9 fields listed above. `undo()` and `redo()` stay at the
  top level — they're methods, not state.
- **Internal `FormState` type renamed to `FormStore`.** The name was
  freed for the new public `FormState` interface (the shape of
  `useForm().state`). Only breaks consumers who imported the
  internal type directly — unlikely but possible.
- **`initialState` config key renamed to `defaultValues`.** Same
  motivation: with `state` reserved for the form-level flag bundle,
  `useForm({ initialState: {…} })` read ambiguously. The new name
  matches RHF's vocabulary. Custom-adapter authors also need to
  rename `AbstractSchema.getInitialState` → `getDefaultValues` (and
  the matching `InitialStateResponse` / `GetInitialStateConfig`
  types). The `runtime/adapters/zod-v4/initial-state` module file
  is now `default-values`.

See [`docs/migration/0.10-to-0.11.md`](docs/migration/0.10-to-0.11.md)
for a full migration snippet with `sed` one-liners covering all four
breakages.

## v0.8.0
**What's new at a glance**

- **Full rewrite of the core.** The pre-rewrite `useState` composables
  are collapsed into a single `FormState` closure per form. Registry-
  backed, framework-agnostic — works under Nuxt 3/4, bare Vue 3, and
  bare Vue 3 + `@vue/server-renderer`.
- **Zod v4 adapter** at `@chemical-x/forms/zod`. The v3 adapter stays
  at `@chemical-x/forms/zod-v3` for existing consumers; the two are
  physically isolated and pick the zod major the consumer installs.
- **Type-inference improvements.** `register` / `getValue` / `setValue`
  / `getFieldState` narrow down to the exact leaf type for any
  `FlatPath<Form>`. New `ArrayPath<Form>` / `ArrayItem<Form, Path>`
  helper types drive the typed array helpers.
- **New surface:** `isDirty`, `isValid`, `isSubmitting`, `submitCount`,
  `submitError`, `reset()`, `resetField(path)`, and the typed array
  helpers (`append` / `prepend` / `insert` / `remove` / `swap` /
  `move` / `replace`).
- **Memory-leak fix.** `FormState` is evicted from the registry on
  the last consumer's scope dispose — prevents accumulation in
  long-lived SPAs.
- **Performance.** The keystroke bench runs several times faster than
  the pre-rewrite baseline; `scripts/check-bench.mjs` fails CI if the
  ratio regresses.
- **CI gates:** bundle size (`size-limit`), coverage (v8 with per-
  metric thresholds), and bench regression all run on every PR across
  the Node matrix. Test-file and intra-file execution order shuffles
  on every run.
- **Tree-shaking.** `sideEffects: false` is declared — unused subpath
  imports drop out of consumer bundles.
- **Docs.** A new `docs/` tree covers the full public API, task-
  oriented recipes (dynamic field arrays, server errors, custom
  adapters, SSR hydration, advanced validation), and per-release
  migration notes.

**Breaking changes**

Two consumer-facing breakages since 0.6:

- `useForm` requires `key`. Compile error without it; runtime error
  if passed `undefined` / `null` / `''`. See
  [`docs/migration/0.7-to-0.8.md`](docs/migration/0.7-to-0.8.md).
- `handleSubmit(cb)` returns a handler function instead of running
  immediately. Bind it directly to `@submit.prevent` or call it
  imperatively. See
  [`docs/migration/0.6-to-0.7.md`](docs/migration/0.6-to-0.7.md).

**Out of scope for this release (future candidates)**

Async validators, a Valibot adapter to validate the
schema-agnostic claim, a bare-Vue playground, an auto-release
pipeline, the Vue DevTools plugin, and published comparison
benchmarks against FormKit / VeeValidate / react-hook-form.
